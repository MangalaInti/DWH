When we build relationships between FACT and DIMENSION tables, the relationship is always many-to-one.
Many records are in the FACT table and there’s only one corresponding record in the DIMENSION tables.

Types of FACT tables:
1.Granular/Transactional FACT table -> Mocst common type of FACT table , 1 transaction = 1 row

2. Periodic FACT table -> 1row != 1 transaction
  transactions over  a particular period(e.g Monthly, weekly

3. Accumulating FACT table → 1 row = process, lot of date/timestamp columns usually present (Ex: supply chain processes having multiple date columns such as order_date, dispatch_date, deliver_date, etc.)


Conformed DIMENSION table →A DIMENSION table would be shared by multiple FACT tables e.g TIME_Dimension
Role Playing DIMENSION table → When a DIMENSION performs more than 1 role, Connecting FACT table with DIMENSION table on multiple conditions
