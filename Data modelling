---Dimensional Data Modeling 
It is a modelling technique in which we store our data in the form of ''Facts & Dimenstions'' for easy quering and reporting.
Dimensional data modeling is generally considered a ''denormalized form of data modeling'''. 
Key Concepts in Dimensional Modeling 

1. Fact Table 
What it is: This table stores ''quantitative data'' like sales numbers, revenue, or order amounts.

2. Dimension Table 
What it is: This table stores descriptive data about the facts (like time, customer, product). 
Dimensions help provide context to the facts.

3. Measures 
What it is: The numeric values in the Fact Table that you want to analyze (e.g., sales, profits, quantities).

4. Attributes 
What it is: These are the details about the data in Dimension Tables.

Dimensional modeling:
- Unique technique of structuring data
- Commonly used in DWH
- Optimized for faster data retrieval 
- Oriented around performance & usability
- Designed Reporting / OLAP


-- What is Data modelling
Data model is a techique to oragnize the data in systematic way so that it be read easily. Its kind of blue print.

start with analysis of data
idenfity the entities and attributes
establish the relationship
primary keys, constraints, indexes

The process of data modelling involves several steps.
  1. Requirement gathering
  2. Conceptual design
  3. Logical design
  4. Physical design
  5. Implementation
